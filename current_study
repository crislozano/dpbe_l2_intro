The goal of the current study is to investigate whether the double phonemic boundary effect can be conceptually cued in adult second language learners. We explore how Spanish-English late bilinguals categorize /b/-/p/ acoustic continuum varying in VOT. Previous research suggests that bilinguals can maintain some degree of separation between sound systems. Language-specific perceptual categorization can be phonetically cued in both early and late bilinguals (Gonzales & Lotto, 2013; Casillas & Simonet, 2018), and conceptually cued in early bilinguals (Gonzales et. al, 2019). 

The two main objectives of the current study are to first, explore the relationship conceptually cueing languages, proficiency, and phonetic categorization. We hypothesize that conceptually cued language-specific phonetic categorization develops as a function of language proficiency, such that adult L2 learners of Spanish will display different phonemic boundaries for each language as proficiency in Spanish increases.
Second, we want to investigate how proficiency level modulates phonetic categorization in late bilinguals. We also hypothesize that here is no relationship between proficiency and conceptually cued perceptual categorization, such that learners will display similar phonemic boundaries regardless of proficiency in Spanish.

In this study, we explore the behavior of late L2 learners (L1 English, L2 Spanish). The L2 learners will be at early, intermediate, and advanced stages of their acquisition of Spanish. The participants completed two two-alternative-forced choice tasks with the same stimuli. Each task started by conceptually cueing a different language (Spanish or English). Importantly, there was a minimum of an hour wait between the first and second part of the experiment.

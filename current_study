The goal of the current study is to investigate whether the double phonemic boundary effect can be conceptually cued in adult second language learners. Previous research suggests that bilinguals can maintain some degree of separation between sound systems. Language-specific perceptual categorization can be phonetically cued in both early and late bilinguals (Gonzales & Lotto, 2013; Casillas & Simonet, 2018), and conceptually cued in early bilinguals (Gonzales et. al, 2019). 

We hypothesize that conceptually cued language-specific phonetic categorization develops as a function of language proficiency, such that adult L2 learners of Spanish will display different phonemic boundaries for each language as proficiency in Spanish increases.

We also hypothesize that here is no relationship between proficiency and conceptually cued perceptual categorization, such that learners will display similar phonemic boundaries regardless of proficiency in Spanish.

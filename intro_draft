Second language (L2) learners need to create a second phonetic system for their L2 in order to understand assign meaning to the sounds in that language. Some sounds will be similar to the sounds in their first language (L1), others will differ, and a third group will require a perception readjustment of L1 phonemes. The independence of the L2 system from the L1 system when phonemes are readjusted is unclear.
Previous studies (Casillas & Simonet, 2018; Gonzales & Lotto, 2013; Gonzales, Heinlein, & Lotto, 2019) indicate that English-Spanish bilinguals exhibit a double phonemic boundary for the phonemic continuum /b/-/p/ (i.e., a difference between labeling functions obtained when listeners find themselves in Spanish mode and those obtained when they are in English mode). These studies provide evidence supporting the notion that there is some degree of separation between phonetic systems in the bilingual mind even for phonemes belonging to a single continuum when the speakers are both auditorily and conceptually cued and when they are auditorily cued exclusively. The present study intends to replicate previous findings when adult L2 learners at different levels of proficiency are only conceptually cued towards one language or another.

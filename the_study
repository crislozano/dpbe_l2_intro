The present article is a conceptual replication of Casillas & Simonet (2018). In their study, they compared the double phonemic boundery effect in simultaneous bilinguals and beginner adult L2 learners of Spanish. Results indicated that whereas simultaneous bilinguals display the double phonemic boundery effect when acousticallye cued in both bilingual and unilingual modes, adult L2 learners showed the effect in the unilingual mode. When L2 learners were faced with the bilingual mode, only more the more proficient learners displayed the effect. 

In our replication, we explore how L2 proficiency impacts the double phonemic boundery effect in adult learners during unilingual mode. Importantly, participants were only exposed to conceptual cues (they were explicitly instructed that they were hearing English or Spanish) as opposed to acoustic cues (inclusion of the Spanish or English realization of the segment **r**). 

Specifically, we try to answer the following research questions: 
1. Can second language learners be conceptually cued ....
2. Does L2 proficiency modulate their ability to separate the two phonemic systems?
